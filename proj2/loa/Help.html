<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of one's pieces into one group of pieces that are connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Initially, the pieces are arranged as shown in Figure 1. Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.
  The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is a path connecting any two pieces of that side's color by a sequence of steps to adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each of which contains a piece of same color. We will also have a move limit L. If the current move limit is L moves (the default is 60), then after the two sides both make L moves combined, the game ends in a tie.

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<p>Just drag and drop the piece with the color that is on your turn. If it is black's turn and it is on manual mode, then you can drag any of its pieces to any square on the board, as long as it is legal. Illegals moves will be ignored. You can also undo moves when it is your turn. The text on the top of the board shows whose turn it is.
You can set the modes of each color by using the settings menu tab. For example, if you want the board to play a game by itself. Set both black and white to auto. If you want to play against the computer, then make one color auto and one color manual.
